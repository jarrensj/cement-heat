# cement heat 

This is to check the temperature of the cement for your dog. 

## Features

- Store in local storage their zip code or city or coordinates 
- Get temperature of that area from an API 
- If there is only temperature of the air, figure out some calculation to get an estimate for the temperature of the cement 

I think later consider things like if the temperature outside was 77 degrees the past three hours, the temperature of the cement is hotter than if the temperature outside was 77 degrees just the past hour and was 50 degrees the two hours prior. 

## Getting Started

install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
